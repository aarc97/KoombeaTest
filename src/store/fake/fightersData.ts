      "Chrom (クロム, Chrom) is a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He was announced as a newcomer alongside Simon, Richter, Dark Samus, and King K. Rool in the Nintendo Direct on August 8th, 2018. Chrom is Roy's Echo Fighter, thus being classified as Fighter #25ε, though his lack of sweetspots makes him parallel Roy the same way Lucina parallels Marth. In addition to his role as a playable character, Chrom remains a part of Robin's final smash Pair Up. Matthew Mercer and Tomokazu Sugita, who voiced Chrom in the English and Japanese versions of Fire Emblem Awakening respectively, reprise their roles in the international and Japanese versions of Ultimate. Both voice actors initially revealed their roles on their Twitter accounts [1] [2].",
